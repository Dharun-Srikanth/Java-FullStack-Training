Started building rest API for todo:
    - I have created rest api called todospringboot
    - First I have created model package,controller package,repository package.
    - I have todo pojo(Plain Old Java Object) class.
    - In Controller Class,I have created endpoints for GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.
    - GET:-For getting all todos from database.
    - POST:-For adding todos into database.
    - PUT:-For updating the todos which are in the database.
    - DELETE:-For Deleting the todods from the database.
    - I have created Todorepository in which i have done dependency injection of Jdbc template for connecting to database and used that jdbcTemplate for querying purpose.
    - All database related details i have kept in application.properties file.
